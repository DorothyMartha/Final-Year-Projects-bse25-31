# Task Management Module

## Proposal
The **Task Management Module** is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage and track tasks within teams or organizations. The application allows users to create, assign, and monitor the progress of tasks, with features aimed at improving team collaboration and productivity. The project integrates several core software engineering practices, including version control, task management, continuous integration, and automated testing.
The frontend of the application is developed using React.js, , offering a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks. The backend is being built using Node.js, handling the business logic and data management through APIs. We are currently working on the backend, and it is expected to be completed in a few days.
Our project emphasizes modern software development workflows, incorporating Git for version control, ClickUp for task tracking, GitLab for continuous integration and deployment.


## Project Goals and deliverables
1. **UI/UX Design:**
 - The UI focuses on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that users can easily navigate the platform to create, assign, and track tasks. Key features include clear task overviews, quick access to task details, and user-friendly forms for task management.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - The backend is being developed using Node.js to handle the core functionality of the task management module, including task creation, updates, and user management through RESTful APIs. Backend development is expected to be completed soon.

3. **Task and Issue Managemaent:**
   - ClickUp is the tool used to plan, organize, and manage project tasks. Each task is linked to specific milestones, and team members track progress through this platform, ensuring deadlines are met.
   

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - We are leveraging GitLab CI to set up continuous integration pipelines. This ensures that every change made to the codebase is automatically built and tested before merging, reducing bugs and improving the overall code quality.

5. **Version Control:**
   - GitLab is being used to manage the project repository, including version control and code collaboration. The team follows best practices such as proper branching, pull requests, and code reviews to maintain a structured and efficient development process.
   
6. **Build and Test Automation:**
   - Once the backend is complete, Gradle or Maven will be used to automate the build process and run tests to ensure the code remains reliable and bug-free throughout the development cycle.
